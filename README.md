# Overview of Project
The project is to help Steve to do a research on green energy stocks in 2017 and 2018. Since Steve would like to diversify his parents' investment instead of investing all money on DAQO New Energy Corp (ticker symbol : DQ), the project would provide a summary table of transaction volume and retrun rate for each stock for Steve and his parents reference.
